# Puss in Boots: The Last Wish
**While I absolutely enjoy watching and rewatching this movie, The thing is if you look more deep into it, you'll notice it having a hidden meaning basically tackling about anxiety, especially with Puss In Boots having anxiety when it comes to evading a villain depicted as Death himself, like with one scene where it shows Puss In Boots having a panic attack**
